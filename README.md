# Customer-Behavior-Retention
SQL queries for customer, order, and revenue analysis in e-commerce datasets.

Overview
This project is built using MySQL to explore and analyze customer and order data.
The main goal is to understand customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue trends through SQL queries.

Think of it as a mini business intelligence project — showing how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights such as customer lifetime value, churn, retention, top products, and average order value.



Key Insights
Some of the insights that came out of the analysis:

A handful of high-value customers contribute a large share of revenue.

Around 40–50% of customers return for repeat purchases — a good retention signal.

Many customers order just once → these are at churn risk.

The top 3 products drive the majority of sales, which is important for inventory planning.

Certain countries generate more revenue → helpful for expansion strategies.

The average order value (AOV) can guide upselling and cross-selling strategies.
